- CimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate
change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions
from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data
from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of
other data. However, it’s hard to grasp how everything is changing in the world at once. This is
where machine learning comes in!

- ClimateWins wants you to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in
mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and
planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it
hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.
